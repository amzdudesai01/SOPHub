Amazon Ads Retail Readiness - Daily Operations SOP
Section 1: Retail Readiness â€” Pre-Campaign Checklist
âœ… Before Launching or Optimizing Campaigns:
Inventory Check: Ensure the product has sufficient stock to support the campaign.

SEO-Optimized Listing: Double-check the productâ€™s listing is fully optimized:

Front End: Title, Bullets, Description, Images, Variations, Reviews
Back End: Search Terms, Subject Matter, Target Audience
A+ Content: High-quality branded content and comparison charts
Pricing & Coupons: Confirm competitive pricing and activate coupons (if applicable).


Section 2: Daily Operations â€” Monitoring & Adjustments
Targeting Health Check
âœ… Review Impressions & Clicks
Ensure every keyword/ASIN receives impressions and clicks.
If low/no impressions after 24 hours, increase bids by $0.05 - $0.15
.
âœ… Pause Overspenders
Breakeven Spend Rule: Pause any keyword/ASIN that hits breakeven spend without converting.
If the keyword drives irrelevant traffic, apply Negative Exact immediately.

Click & Conversion Analysis
âœ… 10-15+ Clicks, No Sales:
Pause keyword/ASIN or re-evaluate the product detail page, when 15+ clicks with no sales:
.
If terms are relevant, lower bids by 10% to manage costs.

âœ… 15+ Clicks â€” Search Term Deep Dive:
Irrelevant Search Terms: Apply Negative Exact or Negative Phrase.
Relevant Search Terms: Reduce bids by 10% to improve efficiency.

Search Term Review Process
âœ… Analyze search terms for every active keyword/ASIN.  Review campaign performance for:
Last 1 Day
Last 3 Days
Last 7 Days
âœ… Compare clicks & conversions directly at the search term level, not just keyword level.




Non-Performing Campaign Recovery
âœ… Review if relevant search terms were mistakenly added as negatives. âœ… Cross-check Negative Targeting List against top-performing keywords.


Section 3: Bid Optimization Process
Impression & Click Review (Every Day)
âœ… After 24-48 hours of low impressions, increase bids by $0.05 - $0.10. âœ… If still low, compare your bid to Amazon Suggested Bids and set at 1.5x Suggested Bid. âœ… Monitor the keywordâ€™s historical performance before making aggressive bid changes.


Section 4: Search Term Deep Dive
ðŸ“Š Daily Search Term Analysis Process
âœ… Review every search term linked to active keywords/ASINs. âœ… Flag underperforming search terms (high clicks, low/no sales).
âœ… For irrelevant terms:
Apply Negative Exact if itâ€™s a specific mismatch.
Apply Negative Phrase if a broader theme is irrelevant (e.g., size mismatch).
âœ… If a keyword generates too many irrelevant search terms, pause the entire keyword/ASIN.
Example:
Product: Sprayway 19oz
Irrelevant Search Term: "Sprayway 29oz"
Action: Add 29oz as a Negative Phrase.

Section 5: Keyword/ASIN Performance Balancing
âœ… Daily Comparison:
Check performance across all keywords/ASINs within each campaign.
Ensure balanced impression & click share across all targets.
âœ… For underperformers:
Increase bids by $0.05 - $0.06.
If still underperforming after 3-5 days, move to dedicated test campaign.
âœ… For overperformers:
Review to ensure they arenâ€™t cannibalizing budget from other important terms.
If healthy, scale bids to maximize sales.


Section 6: Campaign Structure Best Practices
âœ… Single Ad Group Rule:
1 Campaign = 1 Ad Group
âœ… Limit Keywords/ASINs:
Max 8 keywords/ASINs per campaign.
âœ… Target SKUs, Not ASINs:
If new SKUs are introduced, update existing campaigns immediately.
âœ… For New ASINs:
Add to existing ad groups or create dedicated campaigns if strategy differs.


Section 7: Placement Management
âœ… Start Without Placement Bias:
Let Amazon auto-optimize in first 7 days.
Then check placement data and optimize.
âœ… Use Placement Modifiers Intelligently:
Ranking Campaigns: Prioritize Top of Search.
Competitor Targeting: Focus on Product Pages.
âœ… Breakeven Math Check:
Example: Bid $0.50 + 80% Top of Search = Final Bid $0.90

Section 8: Breakeven & Profitability Management
âœ… Breakeven ACOS = Target Profit Margin
Example: 30% Profit = 30% Breakeven ACOS
âœ… Breakeven Spend Formula:
$30 Product Price x 30% = $9 Max Ad Spend before pausing.
âœ… Breakeven CPC Calculation:
If CVR = 10%, Breakeven CPC = $9 / 10 = $0.90
âœ… Track & pause any keyword/ASIN hitting breakeven spend with no conversion.

Section 9: Discovery Campaigns â€“ Negative Targeting Process
âœ… Use tools like AMZ Suggestion Expander to pre-load common irrelevant terms. âœ… Apply negatives during campaign launch based on known product exclusions (e.g., wrong sizes, unrelated materials).
