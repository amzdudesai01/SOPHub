Amazon Ads Mastery - Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)
1️⃣ Introduction to Amazon Advertising
Objective:
This SOP provides a structured approach to Amazon PPC campaigns to maximize visibility, conversion rates, and profitability. It covers campaign types and their appearance on Amazon, targeting options, goal, and optimization strategy.

2️⃣ Types of Amazon Ads
Sponsored Products
Sponsored Products are pay-per-click (PPC) ads that promote individual product listings directly in Amazon’s search results and product pages. They are the most commonly used ad type on Amazon.
Where do they appear?
Search results page (top of search, middle, bottom)
Product detail pages (under "Products related to this item" or "Sponsored Products")



Automatic Campaigns: Amazon selects keywords based on product details.
✅ Automatic Campaign Targeting Options:
Close Match: Ads appear when customer search terms closely match your product.
Loose Match: Ads appear for loosely related search terms.
Substitutes: Ads appear on product detail pages of similar products.
Complements: Ads appear on detail pages of complementary products (often bought together).

Manual Campaigns: Seller selects specific keywords and match types.
✅ Manual Campaign Targeting Options:
Keyword Targeting:
Exact Match (precise keyword matching)
Phrase Match (keyword phrase within search term)
Broad Match (any combination of words in keyword phrase)

Product Targeting:
Specific ASINs (competitor or complementary products)
Categories (refined by price, brand, rating, etc.)

Use auto campaigns for keyword discovery during launch. Use manual campaigns for precise targeting and scaling.

Sponsored Brands
Sponsored Brands are pay-per-click (PPC) ads that promote your brand and a selection of products. These ads include your brand logo, a custom headline, and multiple products (usually 3).
Where do they appear?
Top of search results (banner style)

Middle or bottom of search results

On some product detail pages

Cross-sell or upsell to people who already bought from you
Drive awareness beyond Amazon

Page Visits: Optimizes bids to maximize clicks (CPC), ideal for driving traffic.
Conversions: Optimizes bids for higher conversion rates (CPC), focused on sales performance.

Targeting Options in Sponsored Display
Contextual Targeting:
