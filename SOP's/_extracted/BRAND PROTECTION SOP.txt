BRAND PROTECTION SOP: Ensuring Control & Long-Term Growth on Amazon
As a brand partner it is your duty to protect the brands you work with against unauthorized sellers and bad players. 
Step 1: Gain Brand Registry & Secure Brand Assets

Before enforcing brand protection, you must establish ownership and control over your brand on Amazon.

Enroll in Amazon Brand Registry
	•	Allows trademark protection and the ability to report violations directly to Amazon.
	•	Unlocks access to Project Zero and the Transparency Program (optional).

•	Use Brand Registry’s Report a Violation tool to monitor unauthorized sellers if needed.
	•	Enable brand protection settings to automate IP takedowns for counterfeit listings.
	•	Register your trademarks, copyrights, and patents inside Amazon’s system.

Step 2: Clean Up the Supply Chain & Enforce Distribution Controls

Many brands face unauthorized sellers due to leaks in their supply chain. As a brand growth partner, one of the biggest value-adds is helping brands identify and eliminate these leaks by actively monitoring and managing distributors and online retailers.

Contact Distributors & Online Retailers on Behalf of the Brand
	•	Many brands don’t want to deal with supply chain cleanup. Handling this for them is a major value-add.
	•	Reach out to distributors & online retailers carrying the brand and request that they follow MAP pricing and distribution policies. You can always  mention that you’re reaching out on behalf of the brand.

Issue Authorized Seller Agreements
	•	Clearly define who is allowed to sell on Amazon to maintain price and brand integrity.
	•	Require retailers and distributors to disclose who they sell to.
	•	If leaks persist, cut off problem distributors or retailers.


Enforce MAP (Minimum Advertised Pricing) Agreements
	•	Require all authorized sellers to adhere to pricing policies.
	•	Use Keepa or SmartScout to track violators
	•	Send out MAP agreement policies, warnings, and complaints to sellers violating terms.
	•	Over time, this proactive enforcement will clean up the marketplace.

Step 3: Implement Amazon Transparency (Optional but Effective)

What is Transparency?
	•	Amazon’s product serialization program to prevent counterfeits and unauthorized sellers.
	•	Requires each unit to have a unique Transparency label.

How to Use It Effectively
	•	Amazon states that all units, regardless of sales channel, should require Transparency labeling.
	•	However, Amazon has difficulty enforcing labeling outside of Amazon and there is disconnect amongst Amazon internally about this
	•	What matters most is ensuring that all units destined for Amazon are labeled.
	•	By doing this, most unauthorized sellers will drop off since they won’t be able to source compliant inventory.
	•	Over time, this helps clean up unauthorized resellers without disrupting broader distribution.

Grey Area Alert: While Amazon expects universal labeling, many brands choose to only label Amazon-bound inventory. It remains unclear how brands will be policed on this, but regardless if you know a brand is dealing with potential counterfeits you can help them get enrolled in this program. This approach remains highly effective in eliminating unwanted sellers.

Step 4: Enforce Brand Protection Against Unauthorized Sellers

If unauthorized sellers persist, escalate in stages.

Level 1: Direct Contact (Cease & Desist)

	•	Send a cease-and-desist email requesting they stop selling your products.
	•	Attach proof of your Brand Approval & distribution policy.
	•	Monitor their response (typically within 48-72 hours).

Level 2: Send MAP Violation Warnings & Formal Complaints
	•	Send a formal MAP violation notice to unauthorized sellers and distributors.
	•	Notify authorized distributors that certain retailers are violating pricing or sales policies.
	•	Many unauthorized sellers will stop selling after repeated MAP violation enforcement
(it’s a scare tactic)

Level 3: Amazon Brand Protection & IP Complaints
	•	If sellers do not comply, file an infringement claim via Brand Registry.
	•	Use Amazon’s Report a Violation Tool for counterfeit or trademark claims.
	•	If sellers are using unauthorized images, branding, or content, report them for Copyright IP misuse.

Level 4: Amazon Escalation & Legal Action
	•	If unauthorized sellers persist, escalate via Amazon’s Brand Protection team.
	•	Consult with an Amazon-savvy attorney for a formal legal approach.

Step 5: Ongoing Monitoring & Prevention
Brand protection is not a one-time fix—it requires ongoing monitoring and strategy.
Regularly Monitor Seller Activity
Review Distribution Channels

Final Takeaways:
	•	Brand Registry is the foundation—make sure your trademarks and assets are secured.
	•	Cleaning up the supply chain is a massive value-add—handling this for brands makes you an invaluable partner.
	•	Proactively contacting distributors & online retailers prevents problems before they start.
	•	Sending MAP agreements, warnings, and complaints over time will clean up the marketplace.
	•	Amazon Transparency is a strong deterrent, but brands must understand its nuances.
	•	Escalate strategically—start with cease-and-desist letters, then escalate to Amazon enforcement and legal action.
	•	Monitor consistently—the best brand protection is proactive, not reactive.
