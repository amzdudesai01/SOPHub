2.4 Breakeven Budget Rules
Calculate Breakeven ACoS and Breakeven CPC per product.
Example:
Product Price: $30
Profit Margin: 30%
Breakeven ACoS: 30%
Breakeven Spend per Order: $30 x 30% = $9
Expected Conversion Rate: 10% (1 in 10 clicks converts)
Breakeven CPC = $9 / 10 = $0.90
Compare keywords’ CPC/ACoS with breakeven CPC/ACoS to make data-driven decisions based campaign objectives — either:
Product Scaling: Increase bids for high-potential terms even if CPC is slightly above breakeven to capture market share.

Profitability Focus: Lower bids or pause keywords exceeding breakeven CPC/ACoS to maintain healthy margins.

3.3 Bid Adjustment Calculation (Placement)
In Amazon Sponsored Product campaigns, you can tell Amazon to bid higher for specific placements, such as:
Top of Search (First Page) – The premium spot that gets the highest click-through rates (CTR) and visibility.
Product Pages – Ads shown on competitor product detail pages.
Rest of Search – Ads shown in lower placements (middle of page 1, page 2, etc.).
Why it Matters
Not all placements perform equally. For example, Top of Search tends to have the highest conversion rates because shoppers see these ads first. However, this premium position often comes with higher CPC.
Formula:
Final Bid = Base Bid x (1 + Placement Percentage)
For example:
Base Bid = $0.50
Top of Search Adjustment = 80%
Final Bid = $0.50 x (1+0.80) = $0.90
This tells Amazon you are willing to increase your bid by 80% for Top of Search clicks.

Additional Insights from Your Calculator Explanation
Higher placement adjustments = More aggressive bidding for visibility.
Example: Setting a 60% boost for Top of Search makes sure your ad competes harder for those prime spots.

Product Pages often need smaller boosts.
Since product page clicks have lower CTR and lower purchase intent (shoppers are already looking at another product), you don’t want to overpay.

Rest of Search is usually cheaper.
Lower visibility = Lower intent = Lower bids.

This calculator ensures your bidding strategy aligns with your campaign objective.
Scaling campaigns: You may go aggressive on Top of Search.
Profitability campaigns: You may reduce placement boosts if CPC starts eating into margins.
