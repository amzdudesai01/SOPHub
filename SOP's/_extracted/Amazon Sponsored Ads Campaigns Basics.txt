Each campaign should contain only one ad group with a maximum of 10 keywords/ASINs for precision and clarity.

Close Match
Loose Match
Substitutes
Complements

Section 3: Keyword Targeting Strategies
1.1 Primary Keyword Focus
Identify 1-2 high-search-volume, highly relevant main keywords directly aligned with the product. This will serve as the anchor for your main campaign.
For Example:  I am selling following product:




The main keyword would be "bike wall mount horizontal" that perfectly aligns with the target audience.
1.2 Phrase Targeting
Use 2-3 long-tail variations that enhance the primary keyword, improving precision targeting and capturing high-intent searches.
1.3 Broad Keyword Targeting
Select highly relevant broad match keywords—but avoid repetitive SEO phrases with different word orders. The goal is broader reach without compromising relevance.
Broad Match for Main Keyword Campaign: Select a combination of 2-3 high-volume SEO phrases for the broad match campaign.
If relevant keywords show large search volume differences, split them into separate campaigns for optimized targeting and budget control.

1.5 Search Volume (SV) Tag in Campaign Names
Add SV to campaign names to indicate the keyword search volume range being targeted. Example:
Targeted keyword search volume: 300 to 1000 searches/month
Campaign name: [Product] - Main Keyword - 300>1000
Important: Maintain consistency by ensuring search volume within any single campaign stays within a 2500 search difference.
In Main Keyword Campaigns, SV refers to the exact search volume of the primary keyword.

1.6 Competitor ASIN Targeting
Choose ASINs highly relevant to the promoted product to ensure ads appear alongside complementary or competing items, enhancing conversion potential. Or select from sales benchmarking sheet:
Carbsfuels - Sales Benchmarking
Target individual ASINs frequently purchased as alternatives or alongside your product.
Example:
Using competitor ASIN targeting, we can place ads on frequently purchased alternatives such as:
DUDE Wipes - On-The-Go Shower Wipes ASIN: B01G250MUO
Venture Wipes Large Shower & Workout Wipes ASIN: B0B4GSD2MY
By targeting these ASINs, we position our product alongside competing options, increasing the likelihood of converting shoppers who are considering alternatives.
                                   
1.7 Category Targeting
Focus on product categories that match the product type and align with your target audience’s browsing behavior. Or browse product categories from your or competitor product page:
 
1.8 Product Attribute Targeting
Target search terms emphasizing your product’s unique features, driving differentiation.
For the product "Body Wipes 9"x8", Disposable Bathing Wipes For Adults, No Rinse, With Aloe Vera & Vitamin E, Fresh Scent, 40 Individually Wrapped Wipes", the product features emphasize antibacterial properties and no rinse convenience.

Keyword Research Insight:
During keyword research, highly relevant keywords were identified for ad targeting:
antibacterial body wipes (captures shoppers looking for disinfecting or antibacterial functionality)
no rinse bathing wipes (targets customers seeking rinse-free cleansing solutions)
1.9 Exact Match Precision
Target highly relevant, high-converting keywords in exact match to maintain cost-efficiency and focus.
Example:
For this listing, highly relevant, high-converting keywords in Exact Match can include:
"antibacterial body wipes"
"no rinse bathing wipes"
These keywords ensure precise targeting of customers specifically looking for this type of product, reducing wasted ad spend on irrelevant searches.
1.10 Product Collection Keywords
Target combination keywords  to cross-promote related products in bundles or collections.
Example:
Since these wipes are often used for post-workout cleaning, camping, or personal hygiene, we can target product collection keywords such as:
"gym wipes for body"
"camping hygiene kit"
"body wipes and dry shampoo"
These keyword combinations help promote the product as part of a multi-use hygiene solution, increasing the chances of cross-selling.
1.11 Branded Keyword Targeting
Capture branded searches by targeting brand + product name combinations (e.g., “Nike running shoes”).

Section 4: Additional Best Practices
4.1 Competitor Brand Refinement
Filter competitor brands based on relevancy to ensure your ads appear against the most comparable competitors.
4.2 Competitor Keyword Identification
Find competitor keywords by:
Typing competitor brand names into Amazon search and reviewing autosuggestions.
Running reverse ASIN searches using tools like Cerebro to extract top 10 performing keywords per competitor.
4.3 Conversion Keyword Integration
Keywords with proven high conversion rates from discovery campaigns should be migrated into dedicated CVR campaigns to optimize control and bid strategy.
4.4 Conversion ASIN Integration
Similarly, top-converting ASINs from discovery campaigns should transition into targeted CVR campaigns.
4.5 Initial Bids Formula
Set initial bids at 1.5x Amazon’s suggested average bid to secure competitive placements—especially critical in product launches or competitive niches.
4.6 Sponsored Brand Placement Tactic
While Sponsored Brand campaigns lack direct "Top of Search" bid adjustments, you can indirectly influence placement by lowering bids for non-top-of-search placements, giving more weight to top-of-search impressions.

Pro Tip: This SOP is designed to be dynamic—refine it based on category trends, product lifecycle stages, and real-time performance data to continuously maximize campaign ROI.
